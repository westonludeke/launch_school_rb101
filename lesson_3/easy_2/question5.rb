# Show an easier way to write this array:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

# This was confusing as it's not clear what the question is asking, and I'm not really sure the answer is "easier"

# LS answer:
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
